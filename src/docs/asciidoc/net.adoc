== Asynchronous TCP, UDP and HTTP

"Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws."

=== Overview
How is Reactor Net module working ?

.How Doge can use Reactor-Net

So why should you care about an asynchronous runtime to deal with network operations ? As seen in the <<streams.adoc#streams-microservice, Microservice with Streams>> section, it is preferred to not block for a service reply. Non-Blocking write over network will slightly be more costly than blocking ones in terms of resources, however it might be perceived *more responsive* to the producer. Responsiveness all along the request flow impacts various systems and eventually, 1 or N users waiting their turn to push new requests.

.Doge trades off CPU for Latency for better responsivity and to leave the service available to his friends

Blocking Read or Write become more like a nightmare for concurrent services use over long-living connections such as TCP or WebSocket. Apart from network routing component which might timeout a too long connection, little can be done with a blocking socket in the application locking the thread on read or write IO methods.

Of course there is always the choice to provide for a pool of threads or any _Async Facade_ such as a *Core Processor* to mitigate the blocking read/write contention. The problem is there won't be many of these threads available in a *Reactive* world of non blocking dispatching, so blocking behind 4/8/16 async facades is a limited option. Again the thread pool with a large queue or even many threads won't necessarely solve the situation neither.

.Instead why not invoking callbacks on different IO operations: _connection, read, write, close..._ ?

*Reactor Net* aims to provide an *Asynchronous IO* runtime that supports *Reactive Streams* backpressure for client or server needs over a range of protocols and drivers. Some drivers will not implement every protocol but at least one, *Netty*, implements all current protocols. At the moment, Reactor Net is  *supporting Netty 4.x* and *ZeroMQ* through *jeroMQ 0.3.+* and you must add explicitely one of them in the application classpath.


*Reactor Net* has the following artifacts:

****
* `ReactorChannel` and its direct implementations `Channel` and `HttpChannel`
** Represents a direct connection between the application and the remote host
** Contains non blocking IO write and read operations
** Reactor drivers will directly expose `Channel` to access the `Stream` functional API for read operations
* `ReactorPeer` and `ReactorChannelHandler` for common network component (client/server) contract
** Provides for `start` and `shutdown` operations
** Binds a `ReactorChannelHandler` on `start` to listen to the requesting `Channel`
** `ReactorChannelHandler` is a function accepting `Channel` requests and returning a `Publisher` for connection close management
* `ReactorClient` for common client contract
** Extends `ReactorPeer` to provide a _reconnect_ friendly start operation
* `NetStreams` and `Spec` to create any client or server
** Looks like `Streams`, `BiStreams` and other `Reactor Flux` Factories
** `NetStreams` factories will accept `Function<Spec,Spec>` called *once* on creation to customize the configuration of the network component.
* *HTTP/WS/UDP/TCP* protocol `ReactorPeer` implementations
** `HttpServer` & `HttpClient` will provide routing extensions
** `DatagramServer` will provide multicast extensions
** `TcpServer` & `TcpClient` will provide additional TCP/IP context informations
* *Netty* and *ZeroMQ* drivers

[NOTE]
*Reactor Net* implements a model discussed under the https://github.com/reactive-ipc/reactive-ipc-jvm[Reactive IPC] initiative. As we progress we will align more and eventually depend on the specified artefacts likely over 2016. We give you a chance to experiment as of today with some of the principles and make our best to prepare our users to this next-generation standard.
